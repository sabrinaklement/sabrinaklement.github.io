        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently a third year graduate student in the Mathematics department at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I am advised by Elo&iacute;sa Grifo and I am interested in commutative algebra and homological algebra.
            I am from St. Louis, Missouri, and I received my BS in Applied Math and MS in Mathematics from Missouri State University.
            I enjoy crocheting, reading, and spending time with my dog, Lulu.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my main goals in life is to find a way to use my mathematical expertise to make the world a better place. 
            I would love to contribute to the fight against climate change, and I am also passionate about preserving human rights, including the right to vote.
            Although commutative algebra is not traditionally considered "applied math", I firmly believe that my skills as a mathematician can be applied to solving all sorts of problems.
