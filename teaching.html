        <h2>Teaching Projects</h2>
        <p>
            For the 2023-2024 academic year, I am the Associate Convener for Math 102 - College Trigonometry at UNL. 
            I work together with the faculty convener to maintain continuity across all sections of the course, as well as provide support for graduate student instructors.
        </p>

        <p>
            In summer 2023, I worked on a couple of curriculum development projects. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I worked on course materials for College Trigonometry, which primarily involved making changes to the Course Packet, which is a workbook for students that includes problems meant to be worked on in groups via active learning.
            This summer I added notes pages in addition to the problems, as well as making small changes to existing problems, and writing a few new problems.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another project I worked on was Curriculum Development and Instruction for the College of Engineering's Summer Bridge Program, a program to help incoming first-year undergraduate Engineering majors
            succeed in their math courses.
            The course I worked on was for students who were enrolling in College Algebra in the fall. I worked with a fellow graduate student to develop the curriculum, which consisted of selecting the most important sections and problems from UNL's Intermediate Algebra course.
            I was also the instructor for this course, which ran for two weeks.
